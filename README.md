# Hubble-Constant
Determining the Hubble Constant

> We found the solution to be
- Quadratic fit Hubble constant for z < 1.70 = 62.25 +- 0.77
- Quadratic fit for the deceleration constant q = -0.01 +- 0.06
both in units of km/s/Mpc
The percentage of matter-energy in the Universe that is in Dark Energy is 0.16
