# Hubble-Constant
Determining the Hubble Constant

We found the solution to be
- Quadratic fit Hubble constant for z < 1.70 = 62.25 +- 0.77 km/s/Mpc
- Quadratic fit for the deceleration constant q = -0.01 +- 0.06 km/s/Mpc
- The percentage of matter-energy in the Universe that is in Dark Energy is 0.16
